# Advent of code 2021

In Go.

## Days

### Day 1

Part 1 - complete. Straightforward, basically just iterating around a list of ints checking if
current int is larger than previous.
Part 2 - complete. More complicated, had to some previous 3 days. Good chance to get a bit more
familiar with slices in Go.

### Day 2

Part 1 - complete. Straightforward. Again just iterating and adding numbers
Part 2 - complete. Very minor change to part 1.
