# Advent of code 2021

In Go.

## Days

### Day 1

Part 1 - complete. Straightforward, basically just iterating around a list of ints checking if
current int is larger than previous.

Part 2 - complete. More complicated, had to some previous 3 days. Good chance to get a bit more
familiar with slices in Go.

### Day 2

Part 1 - complete. Straightforward. Again just iterating and adding numbers.

Part 2 - complete. Very minor change to part 1.

### Day 3

Part 1 - complete. Definitely harder and took me a while to get going on this.

Part 2 - complete. Miread the instructions so spent a lot of time with the wrong answer. Initially,
I had thought I was supposed to use the most common character across the entire set rather than
work out the most common character in just the current filtered list. Once I understood that it was
reasonably straightforward to adapt the first part.
